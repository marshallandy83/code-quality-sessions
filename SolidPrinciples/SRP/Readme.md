Single responsibility principle
===============================

## Introduction

The first of the five SOLID principles is the single responsibility principle. This principle states that:

> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

Why does Martin mention a "reason to change"? Well, this is a good way of looking at what exactly we class as a "responsibility" when attempting to apply this principle, and should become clearer as we proceed.

The documentation for this session is split across the following sections:

1. [Applying the SRP at the module level](./Readme-module-level.md)
2. [Applying the SRP at the class/function level](./Readme-class-function-level.md)
3. [Conforming to the principle](./Readme-conforming.md)
4. [Reapplying the changes](./Readme-reapplying-changes.md)
